dpkt is a great packet decoding library that is poorly documented and has few 
examples.  In this project, I propose that we document dpkt.  For each
protocol, there is a set of functions.  Each function needs to be documented.
We will also create sample packet captures and software that decodes the sample
packet captures.

Each protocol is a deliverable.  Each function is a deliverable.  Each sample
packet capture is a deliverable.
